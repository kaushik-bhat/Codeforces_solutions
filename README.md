# Codeforces_solutions
I've attempted to explain solutions for a few Codeforces problems, providing C++ code alongside. 
I apologize for any grammatical or logical errors you may come across in my explanations.


/*
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define f(a,b) for(ll i=a;i<b;i++)
#define ll long long int
#define pb(n) push_back(n)
#define endl "\n"

const ll mod = 10e9+7;
*/


You may notice this code snippet in my solutions, where I've defined ll as long long int and abbreviated the for loop as f(a, b). 
These modifications are for my convenience, and you are free to modify or disregard them as you see fit.
